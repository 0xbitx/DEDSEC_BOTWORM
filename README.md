  <b>Linux based discord bot nuker.</b>

### DESCRIPTION

DEDSEC_BOTWORM is a highly aggressive Discord bot designed to mimic worm-like behavior. It infiltrates servers, sending direct messages to all members with a server invite link, encouraging them to join. Once all members are contacted, BOTWORM initiates a full-scale server nuke, deleting channels, roles, and categories. The process continues as any member who invites the bot into their own server will trigger the same sequence: DM all members, then nuke the server. BOTWORM is a powerful, destructive tool for those looking to unleash chaos across Discord servers in a rapid, viral manner.
